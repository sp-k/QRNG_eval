Entropy = 7.996251 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 5200039.49, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 122.1738 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.256189069 (error 3.65 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000058 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
