Entropy = 7.999400 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 831612.47, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 125.3694 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.188457205 (error 1.49 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000032 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
