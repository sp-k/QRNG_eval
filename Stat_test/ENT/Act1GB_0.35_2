Entropy = 7.992652 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 10196850.95, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 120.0451 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.299639125 (error 5.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000006 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
