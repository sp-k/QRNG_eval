Entropy = 7.999903 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 134412.48, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.6442 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.160772917 (error 0.61 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000016 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
