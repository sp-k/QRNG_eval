Entropy = 7.978551 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 29823784.87, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 114.7759 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.400333046 (error 8.24 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000007 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
