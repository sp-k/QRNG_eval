Entropy = 7.966642 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 46459512.61, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 111.6451 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.455946590 (error 10.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000005 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
