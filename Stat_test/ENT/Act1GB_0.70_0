Entropy = 7.970910 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 40494348.63, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 112.6895 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.437737910 (error 9.43 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000003 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
