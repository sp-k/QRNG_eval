Entropy = 8.000000 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 581.14, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4568 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142417213 (error 0.03 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000018 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
