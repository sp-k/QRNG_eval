Entropy = 7.999976 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 32979.01, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.0771 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.151024237 (error 0.30 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000008 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
