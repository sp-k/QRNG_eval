Entropy = 7.990421 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 13297374.95, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 118.9898 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.320532709 (error 5.70 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000022 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
