Entropy = 7.987886 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 16821796.12, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 117.9313 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.341038789 (error 6.35 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000037 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
