Entropy = 7.978560 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 29810575.62, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 114.7784 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.400517702 (error 8.24 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000001 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
