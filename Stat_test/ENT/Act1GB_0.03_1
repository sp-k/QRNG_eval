Entropy = 7.999945 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 76098.45, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 126.8564 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.155919373 (error 0.46 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000027 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
