Entropy = 7.998646 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 1876910.02, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 124.2993 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.211434781 (error 2.22 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000089 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
