Entropy = 7.974884 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000000 samples is 34941278.45, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 113.7346 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.419156222 (error 8.84 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000022 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
